# Arma3_37RMS_Missions
Hi! I'm Havran, and I am a junior mission maker for Arma 3.
I do missions for my clan 37RM. We are Slovak / Czech clan playing multiplayer missions. Our site: https://37rms.cz/
My missions are open for everybody to play and enjoy.

I do post work in progress and also finished ready missions
You can differentiate between them by reading the "Mission List" file where is a table of each mission and it's completion status. (work in progress/ready to play)

Mission notes, objectives, how to play descriptions or mission intro video links will also be posted in separate files for each mission separately.
In order to play missions correctly, you need to import Havran_modlist file into your Arma3 mods list (changes to main modlist in mission detail files)
Then, download & copy the mission folder into C:\...\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\*YOUR_NAME*\missions/

I hope you'll enjoy them.
